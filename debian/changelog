smarty-lexer (3.1.28+dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Repack upstream tarball due to mal-licensed file (Exception.php, PHP 3.0
    licensed).
  * debian/control:
    + Add D (smarty-lexer): php-pear. We will use Exception.php from php-pear
      instead of the bundled (old and PHP 3.0 licensed) Exception.php.
    + Bump Standards: to 3.9.8. No changes needed.
  * debian/{rules,watch}:
    + Turn src:package into +dfsg1 package. The upstream sources contains one
      file (Exception.php) not appropriately licensed for Debian (PHP 3.0
      instead of PHP 3.01).
  * debian/links:
    + Place symlink Exception.php into /usr/share/php/smarty-lexert, pointing
      to the same file from php-pear bin:package.
  * debian/patches:
    + Add 2001_make-it-usable-for-smarty3.patch. Make smarty-lexer usable when
      building smarty3 (which is its only purpose in Debian).
  * debian/copyright:
    + Drop Exception.php. Removed from upstream source tree.
